Project created just to document the basis of a test automation project

The porpuse of this repository is to give a complete template to be used.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

0 - Tests
Constains the tests projects, use whatever tools you want. I have used Selenium or Refit, both with Specflow

I have used this for writings logs, change database configs for specific tests and to compare critical datas
